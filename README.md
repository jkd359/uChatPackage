uChatPackage
============

Parse Chat Application like WhatsApp & WeChat - uChat

Overview
This is a chat app created using a few different GitHub repositories - using Parse Cloud and Parse iOS SDK and Twilio text message authentication pins.

Will post proper code snippets and squish the bugs if this gets any interest.

A few bugs to flatten out but nothing that a better coder than i couldn't figure out. Eg: Images for the user are placed next to every message sent and not cached properly so a little bit of lag sometimes occurs. Could solve this by placing image at top within navigation bar and so image would only be produced once or could cache the image for re-use.

Features and Requirements
Parse SDK, Parse Cloud Code, Twilio Cloud API used within the Parse Cloud code

iOS8 Ready!
